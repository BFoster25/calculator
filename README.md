Calculator App from "The Odin Project"

This was the final project for the "Foundations" path of "The Odin Project." This project culminated everything that I have learned thus far involving HTML, CSS, and plain JavaScript.

Future opportunities for this project:

-Set digit limit in screen
-Show solution in between numbers
-Bold present operator being used
-When pressing decimal on 2nd number, have it as "." solely, no NaN.
-Keyboard events for numbers, backspace should delete numbers, etc.
